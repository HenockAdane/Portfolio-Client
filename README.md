Hi all, this project is a full-stack multi-page portfolio webiste which show cases projects which I want to use to demonstrate my skills.

The style I was trying to reach for this project was a simple but interactive design that users will have fun with, I done this by putting hover and active animations on some of the elements and function calls.

This project was made using React, React-Router-Dom, SaSS for the UI and UX

If there are any improvments I can make to my code or my projects, then please let me know using the contact methods provided on the contact page.

-Kind regards
